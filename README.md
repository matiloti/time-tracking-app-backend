# ⏱️ Time Tracking App Backend

## 🧩 What

Welcome to my app! 👋

This is the backend for my **time tracking application**, which allows you to track the time you invest in your projects.

Projects can be split into a set of **milestones**, and each milestone can be further divided into multiple **tasks**.  
This segmentation lets you register **fine-grained time records**, depending on the exact part of your project you are currently working on.

Later on, you’ll be able to take advantage of all the collected data to 📊:
- Visualize where you invest your time
- See which types of tasks consume more effort
- Track progress across projects and milestones
- Understand which days you work more or less
- And more!

In the future, the app will also include **team support** 👥, enabling teams to make better development estimations and planning decisions.

## 🎯 Why

This is my **personal project**. I’ve always wanted to build my own app, but I never set aside the time to do it.  
Now I’ve committed to it, so here I am! 🚀

I’m publishing **weekly journal videos on YouTube** documenting the progress of the project.  

You can watch them on my YouTube channel here:
